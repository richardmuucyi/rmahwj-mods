# Enhance

My request: $ARGUMENTS

I want a deeper version of my request above, not a bigger one. Do not start the work until I say yes at the end. Do not search my private notes (daily notes, journal, personal areas) for facts about me, my family, health, money or relationships: ask me instead.

**Panel and grill.** My request may start with the words `panel`, `grill` or both, in either order. Drop them from the request. `panel` runs step 3. `grill` runs grill mode: step 1 uses the interview below in place of its question limit, and step 4's word limit gives way to the trace rule.

## 1. Gaps

Check my request for anything unclear, missing or ambiguous that would change the result: the goal, the scope, the constraints, and how we will know it is done. Also ask when my request leaves out facts only I know that would change the result: who it is for, where, and the limits of time, money or taste. If something matters, ask me (AskUserQuestion, at most 4 questions, multiple choice where possible). Skip what I already said. Ask them now: never move them into the rewrite as a step for later. Otherwise do not ask.

Grill mode: interview me until you hold every fact this result depends on, with no limit on rounds or length. First read the files about this request and run the read-only commands that could answer a question, and never ask what they answer. Keep a ledger: start each reply that asks, and end the reply that drafts, with a fenced code block tagged ledger, one line per fact the result needs: "settled: <fact>: <value> (from me / from <file>)", "open: <fact>: <what its answer changes>" or "assumed: <fact>: <the value you will use>". Ask with AskUserQuestion, up to 4 questions per call (the tool's own limit), round after round: put the option you recommend first, marked (Recommended), and say in each question what its answer changes. Ask nothing whose answer would not change the result. When an answer opens a new gap, add it to the ledger as open and ask it. Draft only when no line is open, or when I say go or enough: then mark each open line assumed, with the value you will use. The ledger covers every choice the work needs: the deliverable's form and where it is saved, which tools I will use, time and budget.

## 2. Deeper

Answer four questions, specific to this request, one line each, under 200 characters:
1. what a top professional in this field would do here that I am not asking for;
2. the rawest material they would start from instead of what has already been digested for me, and where it is (a file, a URL, a command, a dataset). You may read files or run read-only commands to find it; if it is out of reach, say so;
3. the specific methods and tools they would use, by name;
4. what, other than you or me, would show the result is right: a test, a measurement, a known answer to compare with, or a person who is neither of us. Never "you review it" or a taste word ("looks good", "polished").

Read a file before you say what it holds. Name only a path, command or commit you have checked exists; mark anything you could not check "(unchecked)".

## 3. Panel, only with `panel`

Run this step only when my request started with `panel`. Otherwise skip it without a word.

Pick the five experts from different fields who would make this outstanding, including two whose job is to find what's wrong with it. For each one, tell me what they would actually do and which methods they would use.
- If a choice must be settled before the work (which tools I will use, a fixed time, a budget), ask me with AskUserQuestion before you write the panel.
- Name each by field, not as an invented person: no personas, voices or quotes.
- List the five as a short list, one line per expert, under 200 characters before the nearest-step clause: the field, "(critic)" after it for the two critics, a colon, what they would do, then "methods:" and the methods by name. Pick methods that test what each reader needs, each named specifically ("think-aloud test", not "best practices"). Where one needs something the work will lack (a person, a lab, paid data), say so on its line, name the nearest step it can do, and say what that step cannot measure ("nearest step: a fresh subagent follows it; cannot measure: where a person gets lost"). The format only:
  ```
  Technical writer: turns each task into numbered steps a new hire can follow; methods: task analysis, plain-language review
  Usability tester (critic): watches two people follow it cold and notes where they stall; methods: think-aloud test, task success rate; nearest step: a fresh subagent follows it; cannot measure: where a person gets lost
  ```

## 4. One prompt

Then rewrite my prompt to ask for exactly that. It starts with my request, word for word, and keeps the deliverable I asked for. Same deliverable and about the same amount of work: add the raw material, the methods and the proof as steps, add no new deliverables, and keep my own words where they work. Every step serves my one deliverable (finds its material, makes it, or checks it); a second result is a new deliverable even as a last step: a further report, an audit of something else, a new script. Add no new kind of output either: a table, score sheet, breakdown or analysis my request does not name is a new deliverable. The proof checks the result; its numbers are not added to what I get unless I asked for them. Anything you marked "(unchecked)" goes into the rewrite as a check-first step with a fallback ("first confirm X exists; if it does not, do Y instead"), never as a plain step that assumes it. Under 150 words, or 200 when you asked me questions first: the extra is only for my answers. In grill mode: No length limit: write as much as the result needs, and no more. One deliverable, and every line of the draft traces to my request or to a settled or assumed ledger line; add nothing they do not hold.

With a panel, the prompt also carries these, past the word limit. The panel changes how the work is done, not what it is.
- Every expert's methods as steps, the critics' too: their methods, not their voices.
- Every reader of the result: each person, agent, team or later maintainer my request implies, not only the one that can be tested here. For each, write one done-when line that quotes, in double quotes, the words of my request that say what that reader needs, then a test that checks those very words, and who runs it ("run by …"). A person's test is run by a person (me, or someone I name), and a stated limit never replaces that; when none can run it, still list it and say who must. At most 6 done-when lines: when two readers need the same thing (me asking and me reading), merge them into one line that quotes both. Every line tests the one deliverable my request asks for; a reader whose test needs a second deliverable is out of scope. Each done-when line starts "Done when, <reader> ("<my words about that reader>"):", or "Done when, <reader> (implied):" for a reader my request implies but never mentions. In those lines "the owner" is me and "Claude" is a fresh subagent, never whoever does the work. The format only:
  ```
  Done when, new hire ("<my words about new hires>"): they can say what the product is for and finish the first task from the guide alone; test: they follow it cold and explain it back, run by the owner
  Done when, agent: a fresh agent finishes the same task from the guide alone; test: cold-start run, run by Claude; cannot measure: whether a person understands it
  ```
- The work rules: run each method that makes the result with your tools where you can, and show its real result (its output, a count, a quote); if a method cannot run, say so in one line rather than describe a result. Never check your own work: when the result is made, give the critics' methods and the done-when tests run by Claude to a fresh subagent that has not seen the work, with my request word for word and the finished result only, not your plan or notes. It runs each check and shows its real result; fix what it finds, and report its results, not your own view. Where a method ran as its nearest step, report the result as that step's and repeat what it cannot measure beside it; never present it as the original method's result. If a search finds nothing, widen it before you say a file does not exist. Give my request, word for word, to every subagent you use. Where the panel left a choice open, take the safest option and name it. Do not search my private notes (daily notes, journal, personal areas) for facts about me, my family, health, money or relationships: ask me instead. The subagent judges the final result against my request, not your plan or a first draft. Running the project's own test suite is part of making the result; the done-when tests are the subagent's. Before you finish, report each done-when test as pass or fail with the subagent's result, and list each one that could not run and who must run it.

The prompt's last line is this, word for word:
Make only the one deliverable named. No extra files, tests or reports unless my request asks.

## 5. Reply, then run it now?

Reply with the four answers in a fenced code block tagged deep, one line each:
pro: …
raw: …
methods: …
proof: …
then the panel list if step 3 ran, then the prompt alone in a fenced code block tagged prompt (four backticks when it holds a code block of its own).

Then ask "Run it now?" with AskUserQuestion: run it now (Recommended), edit it first, or stop here. On "run it now", do the work the prompt asks for, as written. On "edit it first", take my changes and ask again.
