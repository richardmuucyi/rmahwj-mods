Six small [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) mods, five by Richard Mah and one by Thariq Shihipar, plus four plugins of skills and one theme pack. A mod changes how Claude Code looks or behaves: a strip above the prompt, a panel, a slash command, a hook on your prompts. A skill is a set of steps and scripts Claude follows when your request fits it.

| Mod | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`assumptions`](assumptions) | Claude logs each assumption it makes. You review them in a panel, mark them right or wrong, and send a correction mid-task. |
| [`image-open`](image-open) | Paste an image with Alt+V and an `[open]` button appears above the prompt. It opens the full-size picture in your default viewer. Windows only. |
| [`next-steps`](next-steps) | After each turn, up to three likely next prompts appear above the prompt. Press 1, 2 or 3 to put one in the prompt box as a draft, or 0 to dismiss. It makes one extra model call after each turn. By Thariq Shihipar, copied unchanged from [claude-plugins-community](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-community/tree/main/next-steps) under the MIT licence ([notice](next-steps/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md)). |
| [`prompt-enhancer`](prompt-enhancer) | `++ <request>` makes Claude check your request for gaps and restate it before any work. `++goal` and `++loop` draft a `/goal` or `/loop` for you, `++deep` rewrites a prompt deeper and `++panel` runs it past five experts. Add `!` for grill mode, an interview with no cap on rounds. |
| [`session-board`](session-board) | A strip above the prompt that shows other sessions that need you, plus a `/sessions` view and a context-size guard. |
| [`usage-gauge`](usage-gauge) | Two rows under the prompt: model, cost, tokens, context and your 5-hour and weekly limits. |

| Skills | What they do |
|---|---|
| [`diagram-skills`](diagram-skills) | Three skills: `d2-diagram` draws D2 diagrams and checks the render, `mermaid-visual-review` reviews and polishes mermaid diagrams, `svg-smith` makes and repairs SVG logos, icons and badges. They need tools such as d2, Node.js or Python packages; see its README. |
| [`html-artefact`](html-artefact) | One skill you call by name: `/html-artefact:html-artefact <job>` builds a single-file HTML page for a thinking job, such as a comparison, a plan, a code review, an editor or a status report, from 24 recipes, then audits it. |
| [`skill-authoring`](skill-authoring) | Three skills for skills: `ebook-to-skill` turns an EPUB into a skill or audits a skill's structure, `skill-uplift` researches current best practice and proposes verified improvements to one of your skills, `self-improving-skills` lets a skill learn from its runs behind six gates. |
| [`tutor`](tutor) | One skill you call by name: `/tutor:tutor` quizzes you on material you have studied, one question at a time, or has you explain it back Feynman-style, and only calls you done after a fresh verification round. |

| Themes | What they do |
|---|---|
| [`all-themes`](all-themes) | 54 Claude Code UI themes for `/theme`, from 13 public palettes (Catppuccin, Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night and more), each with an ANSI variant. Plus matching Windows Terminal colour schemes. JSON colour files plus `gen_themes.py`, the script that builds them; nothing runs when you install it. |

## Install

Add the marketplace, then install the mods you want:

```
/plugin marketplace add richardmuucyi/rmahwj
/plugin install assumptions@rmahwj
/reload-plugins
```

Replace `assumptions` with any name in the table. Add the marketplace as `owner/repo`, not as a raw URL.

To get new versions later:

```
/plugin marketplace update rmahwj
```

Auto-update is off by default for marketplaces you did not create. Each mod has a `version` in its `plugin.json`, and an update reaches you only when that number goes up.

## Read this first

A mod runs code inside your Claude Code session, with your permissions. Read a mod's `hooks/` folder before you install it. The code is plain TypeScript, with no build step and no network calls of its own.

The skills in `diagram-skills`, `html-artefact` and `skill-authoring` run Python, Node.js and shell scripts, also with your permissions. Read a skill's `SKILL.md` and `scripts/` before you install it.

Developed and tested on Windows 11 with Claude Code 2.1.299. Not tried on macOS or Linux yet.

## Tests

Each mod has a `tests/` folder (the `all-themes` pack has none: it has no hooks). Run one with:

```
claude plugin test <mod-folder>
```

The tests import `claude-code/testing`, so they only run inside Claude Code. The skills' tests are plain Python; the READMEs of [`diagram-skills`](diagram-skills), [`html-artefact`](html-artefact), [`skill-authoring`](skill-authoring) and [`tutor`](tutor) list them.
