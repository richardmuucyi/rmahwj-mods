"""Tell me what this SVG actually IS before I trust it.

Answers the questions that have burned us: is it really vector, or a clipPath over
a JPEG? Does it depend on a font? What is the artwork bbox (not the viewBox)? Which
ids or classes would collide if I inline it next to another file? Is the figure a HOLE,
so the ground shows through and the mark inverts on dark?

With --set it also compares the files to EACH OTHER -- optical size, grid, stroke weight,
palette. A family of marks fails in the relationships between its members, and no
per-file check can see that.

    It matters because a knockout has no colour: the ground shows through it. The same file

    Nothing else in the harness reports this, and it shipped once before it was noticed.
