"""Measure a mark against reference marks on proxies that correlate with "looks professional".

This exists because "it looks cheap" is the least actionable feedback there is. These numbers
will not tell you whether a mark is beautiful — nothing will — but they turn three specific
failures into something you can target:

  transitions/row  Silhouette complexity, i.e. rhythm. Great badge marks get visual interest
                   from REPETITION: the Starbucks siren's wavy hair strands, CHAGEE's cluster
                   of spheres, the tawara segments edging a dohyo. A mark made of two or three
                   flat blobs scores low and reads as cheap no matter how the curves are tuned.
                   Measured: Starbucks 7.4, CHAGEE 5.4. A draft that scored 2.2 was rejected
                   on sight by the client; the redraw that scored 6.4 was not.

  ink balance      Figure vs field. Wildly lopsided marks tend to read as either a blob or a
                   thin scratch. Less diagnostic than rhythm — treat as context, not a target.

  detail survival  transitions/row at 24px divided by the same at 400px. How much of the
                   silhouette still exists when it is small. Near 1.0 means the mark shrinks
                   honestly; near 0 means everything you drew turns to mud and you owe the
                   client a separate small-size drawing.
